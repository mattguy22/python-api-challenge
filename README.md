This project involves using Python APIs, data analysis, and visualization tools to exploe weather data across the globe, and identify and map ideal vacation destinations based on defined weather conditions. WeatherPY script analyzes weather data for 500+ cities worldwide to identify patterns and relationships between latitude and weather variables.  VacationPy script filters cities based on ideal weather conditions, finds nearby hotels, and creates interactive maps to visualize vacation desitinations.
