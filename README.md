Module 6 Challenge
Used chatgpt for the <time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")>
Used chatgpt for <plt.grid(True)> to get grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability
Used chatgpt for building the function specifically the code that performs the linear progression, creation of the regression line, and how to annotate the gression equation and R^2 value.  
All plotting of the scatter plots code was referenced through out Module 5.  
I also added the <plt.grid(True)> function all scatter plots.  With this amount of data points to increase readability.
